I'm think of makeing a 3D rendering of my room at my dads house in Texas. I dont hav any pictures of my room on me and my drawing would just look like a box. But the room is a plain 10x10 ft room with a shelving unit full of model cars and model planes. There is also a table with a tv and a inset in the wall with desk for a desktop and bookshelves above it. There is a fairly large window and also 2 matresses stack on top of each other in the corner.

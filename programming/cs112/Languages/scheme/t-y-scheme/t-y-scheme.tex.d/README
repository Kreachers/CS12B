README

This archive contains the TeX source for the document
"Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days".  This document
is copyright Dorai Sitaram, 1998-2002, and is freely
readable and distributable.  It is written in
plain TeX format and uses a BibTeX bibliography.  An
HTML version may be browsed online at 

  http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme.html

To get a DVI version of the document, run

  tex t-y-scheme
  bibtex t-y-scheme
  makeindex t-y-scheme
  mpost numint
  tex t-y-scheme
  tex t-y-scheme

The first tex run may cause an error because an
EPS file is missing.  Simply type `s' at the 
TeX prompt to force TeX to continue. 

The multiple runs of tex are needed to resolve
cross-references.  If the MetaPost executable
is named `mp' on your system (e.g., MiKTeX), 
change `mpost' to `mp'.

If you want a PDF version of
the document, use pdftex instead of tex in the
commands above.

To get an HTML version of the document, run

  tex2page t-y-scheme

a few times.  As with TeX, multiple runs of tex2page
are needed to resolve cross-references.  Each run
of tex2page will tell you if another run is necessary.

The tex2page program is available at

  http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~dorai/tex2page/tex2page-doc.html
